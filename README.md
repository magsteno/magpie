stenographic theory for Shavian input

Magpie theory is an orthographic input system primarily for the Shavian alphabet.
It is currently in early days but I hope to bring something more soon.

## How to use
shavian.py and necessarybriefs.json are dictionary files for [Plover](https://github.com/openstenoproject/plover). shavian.py requires the plover-python-dictionary plugin (which can be added within Plover using the in-built plugins manager under Tools).
Add these both to plover, ensure necessarybriefs.json has higher priority, and set Output to Enable.
